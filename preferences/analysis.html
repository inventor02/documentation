<p>For JavaScript files, Codeanywhere provides analysis using a combination of our own analysis tools, as well as JSHint (specifically for Javascript code). Our language analysis can't detect if your program is correct, fast, nor has memory leaks, but it can save you time by spotting things like undeclared variables, syntax errors, or other preventable typos.
When Codeanywhere detects an issue with your code, an icon appears in the gutter (located left from the editor) for the offending lines of code.</p>
<p>If you hover over any of these icons in the gutter, you'll get a pop-up that presents some information as to what, exactly, the problem is.</p>
<p>There are a lot of parameters in which criteria linting should be done. You can change this parameters using Linting Preferences.</p>
<p>Using GUI Preferences, you can set your linting preferences and when you are done, just choose &quot;Save&quot; option.</p>
<p><img src="images/linting.png" alt="goto" title="linting" /></p>
<p>If you are defining preferences using JSON you must follow the Default Linting Preferences syntax which you can see at the bottom of this section.</p>
